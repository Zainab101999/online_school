Building a database for a website that offers online courses is the basis of this data modelling assignment. The website is for selling online courses such that people can sign up and enroll in one or more courses. Instructors record these classes and post them to the website. One or more tags, such as front-end or back-end, may be added to a course. To build the database, I first developed a conceptual model with two entities—students and courses—and then, based on that, I developed a logical model to which I added a third entity, enrolment.
By using normalisation to eliminate data duplication, I created a physical model on MySQLWorkbench based on the logical model. 
I used forward engineering to build the database after building the model and choosing the primary keys for each table.
